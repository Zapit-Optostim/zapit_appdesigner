# Zapit_Appdesigner

MATLAB `appdesigner` files for the zapit optostim software.
The GUIs are made in `appdesigner` and saved as `.mlapp` binary files, which are kept in this repository. 
The exported `.m` files area in the [the main zapit repo](https://github.com/Zapit-Optostim/zapit) and are never modified. 
The views are inherited by a "controller" which runs the GUI.
